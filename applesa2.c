/*I want to know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.
So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in an array called stock_prices, where:
The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stock_prices[60] = 500.
Write program in C that the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.
For example:
  stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
the program should returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
No "shorting"�you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time step�at least 1 minute has to pass. */

Instead of 3 nested for loops is there a better way?
